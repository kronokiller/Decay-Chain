# The decay rate is specified as "half-life", "decay constant", or

# notation, and the units may be "s", "m", "h", "d", or "y"

Decay Rate A = half-life, 1.2, h

# The initial count of each atom may be given in moles or without units
# The units for moles is "mol". If unitless leave the space after the comma blank

Initial Count C = 0,

# The time delta for numerical solutions and the final time may be
# entered the same way as the decay rate magnitude and units

Time Delta = 1, h
Final Time = 50, h
