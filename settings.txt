# Run Main determines whether the input file will be read and an output file generated.
# Generate Reference Graphs determines whether lower resolution graphs with relevant counts vs time will be drawn and saved
# Run Multiple allows multiple output files to be generated by halving the time delta after each time main() is called
# If Run Multiple is True main() will be repeatedly called until all counts from the previous data set change
# by less than or equal to the Percent of Total times the total count
# The first three values should be true or false, the Percent of Total should be a float and a unit separated by a comma
# The unit may be "" or "%" where "1, %" is the same as "0.01,"

Run Main = True
Generate Reference Graphs = True
Run Multiple = True
Percent of Total = 0.05, %

# When plot is true, three plots will be made using output files that were just generated or previously generated
# User Input for Plotting allows the user to input the settings listed below in the terminal according to prompts
# This may be useful if you want main to be called only once but don't know which output files to use before runtime
# These two values should be either True or False

Plot = True
User Input for Plotting = False

# The following image names should be typed without an extension
# Image 1 is a graph of N_B vs t with three values of Delta t and an analytical solution
# Image 2 is a graph of each numerical solution along with the total count for a small Delta t
# Image 3 is a graph of the time of maximum N_B vs the inverse of Delta t for several values of Delta t

Image 1 Name = imageN_B
Image 2 Name = imageNumerical
Image 3 Name = imageMaxN_BVsDt

# The coarse, medium, and fine data numbers are the number of the output file which appears after "output" and before ".txt"
# These numbers should refer to output files with large, medium, and small Delta t values respectively
# These numbers should be integers

Coarse Data Number = 0
Medium Data Number = 1
Fine Data Number = 7

# The Data Numbers are the numbers of the output files similar to those above which should be used to generate the third image
# These numbers should be a comma separated list of integers without square brackets

Data Numbers = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
